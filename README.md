# 3D Printing Quickstart
A resource for the novice getting started with 3D filament printers

## Things to keep in mind
- **Embrace tinkering:** 3D printers are **not** like 2D paper printers. There's a lot more that can go wrong. 
- **Embrace imperfection:** Most prints will have small issues (stringing, small blobs, etc). Cleaning them up is part of the process
- **Test prints:** Make small test prints before tackling largers projects. Learn & adjust from all prints
- **Don't change too many parameters at once.**
- **Take it easy!** It's a cool technology with incredible potential. Don't get frustrated if things aren't immediately perfect.

## Setting up & maintaining your printer
- Make sure bearings are not too loose or tight
- Make sure belts are not too loose or tight
- Filament roller resistance (aka keeping the filament feeder from pulling on the print head)
- 

## Things to do before & between prints
- Check printer home
- Level your print bed
- Clean the print bed with a damp cloth. Try not to touch the bed (leaving skin oil on surface)


## Things to do before using a new filament spool (or material type)
- Make test prints to check optimal temperature and retraction amount for your printer
-   
- 

## Filament types
### PLA
- relatively easy to print
- Settings: 60C print bed temp, 200-220C nozzle

### PLU





# Resources
## Test Print Tools
Test prints are generally small, quick prints that allow you test parameter changes (temperature, retraction speed, etc) within the same print.
- [Generate Test Prints](https://teachingtechyt.github.io/calibration.html) for temperature, retraction, and other settings
- **Temperature Tower** 
- **Benchy**

## 3D Models and editors
You'll need 3D models to print. Often this is done by taking a .STL file and creating slicing code in a slicer software. Start by downloading existing models. Then use one of these various editors to make your own designs.

### 3D Models

### 3D Editors
- **[TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/):** Free, beginner-friendly, in-browser 3D modeling tool. This software allows you to build your own models and export .STL files for slicoing & printing.



## Slicer software
Slicers are used to turn a 3D model into machine code the printer understands
- **[PrusaSlicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/)**: Free software from Prusa Labs that supports printer from multiple manufacturers. 
- **[Bambu Studio](https://bambulab.com/en-us/download/studio):**
- **[Ultimaker Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura/):**
